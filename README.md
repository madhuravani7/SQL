# SQL
1. Covid19 Data - Project 1<br/>
   I have worked on Covid data with more than 300k rows and used sql statements like select, where, joins  to get hold of countries with high death rate, population, vaccination rate and more. Also, used aggregate
   functions like max, sum, count etc. And created temp tables to hold data for further use, and cte to easily write queries and get certain data, and also views. <br/><br/>
2. Nashville Housing (data cleaning) - Project 2<br/>
   I deleted duplicates, altered columns, added new columns, used update, alter, insert etc statements, used ctes to get hold of data that no longer is important and deleted and more. <br/><br/>
